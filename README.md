Numerology assignment - tkinter GUI no pillow library

Wanted to create a GUI with a barebones python, as in no additional installations.

Lots of featues left to add or fix:
  - Submit button disable/enable
  - Disallow window resizing
  - Show more meaning to the output results or
  - create new screens to show additional information about numerology numbers
  - GUI could look more refined
